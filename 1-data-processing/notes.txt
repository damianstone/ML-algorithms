### Features (independent variable)
The features are the column with which you're going to predict the dependent variable

### Dependent variable vector
The import or the result column: for example, the dataset would be the "purchased"
because we're looking to predict if some future customers are going to purchase 
a certain product based on these information

Usually in the last column of the dataset
