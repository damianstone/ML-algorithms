-*- Features (independent variable)

The features are the column with which you're going to predict the dependent variable

-*- Dependent variable vector

The import or the result column: for example, the dataset would be the "purchased"
because we're looking to predict if some future customers are going to purchase 
a certain product based on these information

Usually in the last column of the dataset

-*- Handling missing data

For example if we have a salary column and one row doesn't have a salary, then one way
to handle this missing data is to assing it the average of all salaries 

-*- Enconding categorical variable
One-hot encoding -> represent categorical variables in binary so we don't any order number problems
