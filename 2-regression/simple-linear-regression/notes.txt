Simple linear regression is used when we have two variables and we want to model their relationship.

Specifically, we use simple linear regression when:

1- We have a continuous target variable we want to predict based on one continuous predictor variable.
   For example, predicting a person's weight based on their height.

2- We believe the relationship between the predictor and the target variable is linear,
   meaning that a change in the predictor leads to a proportional change in the target variable.

3- We want to understand the strength and direction of the relationship between the predictor
   and the target variable. In other words, we not only want to make predictions,
   but also interpret the model to understand how the variables are related.
